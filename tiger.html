                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                      <p>Tremendous Tigers: Tigers are like the kings and queens of the jungle â€“ they're big, bold, and oh-so-beautiful! With their striking orange fur covered in black stripes, they're nature's most fashionable felines. And guess what? They're super stealthy hunters too, prowling through the forests with a silent grace.</p>

<p>Territories of Tigers: These magnificent creatures call a variety of habitats home, from the dense jungles of India to the snowy forests of Russia. Whether they're stalking prey in the tall grass or taking a dip in a cool river, tigers know how to make any environment their own.
</p>

<p>Indian Tiger Tales: India is like a treasure trove for tiger lovers! Here, the majestic Bengal tigers rule the roost, blending in perfectly with the lush greenery of the forests. From the famous Ranthambore National Park to the Sundarbans mangrove forest, there's no shortage of places to spot these regal beasts.</p>
